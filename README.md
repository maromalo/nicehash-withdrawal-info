# nicehash-withdrawal-info
A small Python script that lists most of the withdrawal options via crypto in NiceHash.

Note: Due to NiceHash not having an API for their server status (this includes withdrawals) you should always check beforehand on https://status.nicehash.com/ under "Currencies status" whether withdrawals for a specific coin are operational or not.

Example output (not updated):
